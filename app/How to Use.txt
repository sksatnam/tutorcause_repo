How to make it work:

#1. Place all files at their respective locations. For example place place captcha.php file inside your projects /app/controllers/component directory.

#2. Make /app/webroot/img/captcha directory writable (chmod 0777)

#3. If using component in a different controller than this package's captcha_controller.php copy paste both functions to your controller function area.

#4. Access website url like this conrollername(captcha)/captcha_test and you should see the captcha image having a text field under it.

Thats it!
